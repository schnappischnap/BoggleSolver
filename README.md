# BoggleSolver
A C# Windows Forms application to solve 4x4 Boggle boards.

- The BoggleSolver class can solve any valid Boggle boards, regardless of size.
- Uses a recursive method to perform a depth-first search of the board.
- A trie allows us to prematurely end searches for words with invalid prefixes.
